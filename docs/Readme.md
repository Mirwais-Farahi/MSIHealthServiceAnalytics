# Client Exit Interviews
- A Client Exit Interview (CEI) is a survey 
administered to clients by a trained interviewer 
immediately following a clientâ€™s healthcare visit 
at the site of service delivery (These are: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, 
Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Senegal, Sierra 
Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Bolivia, Nepal, Timor Leste, Burkina 
Faso, Zimbabwe, India, Niger, and Democratic Republic of the Congo).
- The methodology and design of the CEIs enable 
the collection of high-quality, representative 
data on client demographics, previous healthcare 
service use and behaviours, client experience and 
satisfaction, marketing and referrals, and social and 
communal norms. 

- We choose to use client to refer to people who have received services from MSI 
Reproductive Choices. Client is a gender-neutral term, meaning it covers women and 
pregnant people, including trans men and non-binary people, who require access to 
family planning care.

- The CEI questionnaire template ([MSI Client Exit Interview Quesionnaire](../docs/CEI_Questionniare_v2024_MSIA_V2_ZS.pdf)) reflects key indicators for family planning 
clients, structured in the following modules:
    - Module 1: Interview and Site Information
