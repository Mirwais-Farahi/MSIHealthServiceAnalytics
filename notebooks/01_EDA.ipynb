I realize some of these questions seem unrelated to healthcare and may be sensitive, but they help us to understand what our clients’ living situations are like, and the more we understand the better services we can provide. Your answers will not affect the service you receive or the price you pay, now or in the future. If you do not feel comfortable at any point during the questions, please let me know.
