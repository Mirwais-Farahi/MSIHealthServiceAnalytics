# Data Analysis Methodology for Client Exit Interviews (CEIs) in Afghanistan Using the PACE Framework

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the Client Exit Interview (CEI) data from 11 provinces of Afghanistan to improve family planning services. The focus is on understanding client satisfaction, service accessibility, and other factors that influence the healthcare experience. The analysis follows the PACE framework (Plan, Analyse, Construct, Execute) for structured data analysis and actionable insights.

## Methodology

### 1. Plan

- **Setting Goals**: The goal is to analyze CEI data from 11 provinces to improve family planning services. The analysis will focus on client satisfaction and the accessibility of healthcare services.
- **Scope**: This analysis includes data from surveys that capture client demographics, service access, satisfaction, and other relevant factors.
- **Workflow**: 
    - Data will be collected through surveys.
    - Data cleaning will be done to address missing data, inconsistencies, and errors.
    - Descriptive statistics and Washington’s Index will be applied to analyze and index the data.
    - Data visualization will be done using Python in Google Colab.

### 2. Analyse

- **Data Collection**: CEI surveys are conducted with clients in 11 provinces immediately after their healthcare visits. These surveys focus on various aspects of healthcare experience.
- **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Missing values and inconsistencies in the data will be handled.
    - Errors in the dataset will be corrected to ensure accuracy.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: 
    - Basic descriptive statistics (e.g., averages, percentages) will be computed to summarize the data and identify trends.
- **Disability Analysis**: 
    - Washington’s Index will be used to assess the impact of disabilities on the client’s experience.
- **Visualization**: 
    - Graphs and charts will be created using Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to visualize trends and patterns in the data.

### 3. Construct

- **Insights**: 
    - The descriptive analysis will generate key insights about service delivery, client satisfaction, and access to healthcare services.
    - These insights will be visualized using charts and graphs that highlight differences across provinces, demographics, and client experiences.
    - The visualizations will make it easier for stakeholders to understand the findings.

### 4. Execute

- **Presentation**: 
    - Results will be presented in clear and comprehensive reports that include both numerical analysis and visual representations of data.
    - Visualizations will be used to effectively communicate the key findings.
- **Feedback Collection**: 
    - Feedback from stakeholders will be gathered to refine the analysis and explore any additional areas that may require further investigation.
- **Actionable Insights**: 
    - The findings will be used to generate actionable recommendations aimed at improving family planning services and enhancing client satisfaction across the provinces.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Google Colab**: Used for running Python code and data analysis in the cloud.
- **Python Libraries**: 
    - `pandas` for data manipulation.
    - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
    - `numpy` for numerical operations.
    - `scipy` for statistical analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding client experiences with family planning services in Afghanistan. By analyzing CEI data, stakeholders can gain valuable insights that will inform decisions to enhance the accessibility, quality, and satisfaction of services provided in the provinces.
